# **B.E.V.I** (*Bird's Eye View Instantly*)
**B.E.V.I** provides map-making tools for fictional worlds, in a 2D top-down environment! **B.E.V.I** is created and developed by three students of George Mason University, for a CS 321 class. B.E.V.I. allows the user to make maps of a smaller area (such as a town or village) with a focus on story building and information storage. This is done through allowing a myriad of information to be stores with each element on the map.

**VERSON CONTROL NOTE:** Currently, B.E.V.I. is being managed by the Unity Cloud, as it is a unity project. However, releases can be found on the release page for this repository and the assets folder is updated with every release, allowing code to be reviewed and looked over!
